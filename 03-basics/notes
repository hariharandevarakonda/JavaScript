Java Script Execution Context
-> it will show you how a code is executed in Java Script
There are two phases 

1.Global Execution Context. we 'THIS' varibale in this context.
2.Functional Execution Context.
3.Eval Execution Context.

->{} this is a block of code in JavaScript. we have two phases where it shows how our code runs.
1. first one is memory creation phase.It is  also called as creation phase.Here it allocates place to the variable or anything else we declare there. But it will not get executed.
2. second one is Execution phase.
